And if you go about it the right way, investing in stocks is just as easy as parking your money in bonds and cash.\nAmidst the bear market that began in 2000, it\u2019s understandable if you feel burned\u2014and if, in turn, that feeling makes you determined never to buy another stock again. \nAs an old Turkish proverb says, \u201cAfter you burn your mouth on hot milk, you blow on your yogurt\u201d.\nBecause the crash of 2000\u20132002 was so terrible, many investors now view stocks as scaldingly risky; but, paradoxically, the very act of crashing has taken much of the risk out of the stock market.\nIt was hot milk before, but it is room-temperature yogurt now.\nViewed logically, the decision of whether to own stocks today has nothing to do with how much money you might have lost by owning them a few years ago. \nWhen stocks are priced reasonably enough to give you future growth, then you should own them, regardless of the losses they may have cost you in the recent past. \nThat\u2019s all the more true when bond yields are low, reducing the future returns on incomeproducing investments. \nAs we have seen in Chapter 3, stocks are (as of early 2003) only mildly overpriced by historical standards. \nMeanwhile, at recent prices, bonds offer such low yields that an investor who buys them for their supposed safety is like a smoker who thinks he can protect himself against lung cancer by smoking low-tar cigarettes. \nNo matter how defensive an investor you are\u2014in Graham\u2019s sense of low maintenance, or in the contemporary sense of low risk\u2014today\u2019s values mean that you must keep at least some of your money in stocks.\nFortunately, it\u2019s never been easier for a defensive investor to buy stocks. And a permanent autopilot portfolio, which effortlessly puts a little bit of your money to work every month in predetermined investments, can defend you against the need to dedicate a large part of your life to stock picking.\nBut first, let\u2019s look at something the defensive investor must always defend against: the belief that you can pick stocks without doing any homework. \nIn the 1980s and early 1990s, one of the most popular investing slogans was \u201cbuy what you know.\u201d \nPeter Lynch\u2014who from 1977 through 1990 piloted Fidelity Magellan to the best track record ever compiled by a mutual fund\u2014was the most charismatic preacher ofthis gospel. \nLynch argued that amateur investors have an advantage that professional investors have forgotten how to use: \u201cthe power of common knowledge.\u201d \nIf you discover a great new restaurant, car, toothpaste, or jeans\u2014or if you notice that the parking lot at a nearby business is always full or that people are still working at a company\u2019s headquarters long after Jay Leno goes off the air\u2014then you have a personal insight into a stock that a professional analyst or portfolio manager might never pick up on. \nAs Lynch put it, \u201cDuring a lifetime of buying cars or cameras, you develop a sense of what\u2019s good and what\u2019s bad, what sells and what doesn\u2019t... and the most important part is, you know it before Wall Street knows it.", "sentences": [{"index": 0, "text": "The best defense is a good defense.", "words": [{"text": "The", "posLabel": "DET", "index": 1, "type": "", "optional": false}, {"text": "best", "posLabel": "ADJ", "index": 2, "type": "", "optional": false}, {"text": "defense", "posLabel": "NOUN", "index": 3, "type": "", "optional": false}, {"text": "is", "posLabel": "AUX", "index": 4, "type": "", "optional": false}, {"text": "a", "posLabel": "DET", "index": 5, "type": "", "optional": false}, {"text": "good", "posLabel": "ADJ", "index": 6, "type": "", "optional": false}, {"text": "defense", "posLabel": "NOUN", "index": 7, "type": "", "optional": false}, {"text": ".", "posLabel": "PUNCT", "index": 8, "type": "", "optional": false}]}, {"index": 1, "text": "After the stock-market bloodbath of the past few years, why would any defensive investor put a dime into stocks?", "words": []}, {"index": 2, "text": "First, remember Graham\u2019s insistence that how defensive you should be depends less on your tolerance for risk than on your willingness to put time and energy into your portfolio.
